# 03: Triggering different sequences based on context or interaction

How could we trigger different sequences based on user or context interaction? In this example, we will create a little ItsyCreature that sleeps peacefully until disturbed – in that case it wakes up and gets angry at the disturbance! 

Connect the Chainable LED to pin `D13`, the Servo Motor to pin `D2` and the Touch Sensor to `D3`. By default, the creature will “sleep” in peace, but when touched get angry until the sensor is released again.

##--- Library Imports
import time
import board
import p9813
import pwmio
import digitalio
from adafruit_motor import servo
from varspeed import Vspeed

##--- VarSpeed Variables

MIN_LED = 0  # The minimum  possible value of our component
MAX_LED = 255  # The maximum possible value of our component

vs_led = Vspeed(init_position=MIN_LED, result="int")  # init_position = initial start position // result = float, int
vs_led.set_bounds(lower_bound=MIN_LED, upper_bound=MAX_LED)  # make the output of the function be within the bounds set

MIN_SERVO = 0  # The minimum  possible value of our component
MAX_SERVO = 180  # The maximum possible value of our component

vs_servo = Vspeed(init_position=MIN_SERVO,
                  result="int")  # init_position = initial start position // result = float, int
vs_servo.set_bounds(lower_bound=MIN_SERVO,
                    upper_bound=MAX_SERVO)  # make the output of the function be within the bounds set

##--- Hardware Setup

# Add a touch sensor
touch = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D3)
touch.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT

pin_clk = board.D13
pin_data = board.D10
num_leds = 1
leds = p9813.P9813(pin_clk, pin_data, num_leds)

pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)  # create a PWMOut object on Pin D2.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)  # Create a servo object, my_servo
my_servo.angle = MIN_SERVO  # set the servo to a known starting point

##--- Custom Movement Sequence
# This is where we can define the brightness of our LDED
# The sequence will go through each entry and move to the next entry
# The sequence is defined in this format: (next-position,seconds-to-move,number-of-steps,easing function)
# Take a look at different easing functions here: https://easings.net
