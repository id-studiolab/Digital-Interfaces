# Animistic Design

In the coming two weeks, we are creating an animistic creature â€“ a digital interface that seems alive through different behaviors! 

After exploring non-blocking code in the Party Lamp assignment, we will now apply these concepts to create more complex interactive behaviors. This assignment focuses on creating an object with at least two different (opposing) behavioral states that can be triggered by sensors and expressed through various outputs.

## Assignment Overview

Your task is to design and program an animistic creature that has a distinct personality expressed through at least two opposing behavioral states (e.g., calm/agitated, shy/curious, sleeping/awake). Your prototype should respond to sensor inputs and change its behavior depending on the state it is in.

## The VarSpeed library

Last week we experimented with timers to write non-blocking code. This allowed us to check if a button was being pressed even while fading a led. But using timers is not the only way to achieve this. A different approach involves using the **VarSpeed* library.

Go through the page below to learn what the **VarSpeed** library does and how to use it, then come back to this page once you're done.

## Coding assignment

Your assignment is to design your own acting diagram and then implement it in the code.
Here below we provide a code template to help you get started.
