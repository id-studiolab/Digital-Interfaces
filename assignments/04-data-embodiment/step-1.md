# Setting up MQTT on your ItsyBitsy

After successfully completing [Tutorial 4](https://id-studiolab.github.io/Connected-Interaction-Kit/tutorials/03-connect-to-the-internet/) and connected your ItsyBitsy to the Internet, follow the steps below to establish a basic MQTT connection with our MQTT server.

1. Extend your `settings.py` file and add the entries for the MQTT broker (the server we connect to), be sure to set your username in the parameter called **mqtt_clientid** (please construct it as **Studio[your studio]_YourName**). Save the file afterwards.
```python
settings = {
	"ssid" : "TUD-facility", # The wifi we connect to 
	"password" : "replace-with-your-iPSK-String", # Our personal password to connect to Wifi
	"mqtt_broker" : "ide-education.cloud.shiftr.io", # The MQTT server we connect to
	"mqtt_user" : "ide-education", # The username for connecting to the server
	"mqtt_password" : "Sy0L85iwSSgc1P7E", # The password for connecting to the server
	"mqtt_clientid": "Studio5_Caspar", # The device name we present to the server when connecting
}
```

2. We've created a library that helps your microcontroller connect to WiFi, connect to an MQTT broker and takes care of the details of receiving and publishing messages. 
Download the library using the button below, unzip it, and place the file named `MQTT.py` directly in the `lib` folder on your microcontroller. Don't put the entire folder in `lib` - just the `MQTT.py` file itself.

If you followed the tutorial to connect to the wifi replace that code with the one below, otherwise create a new `code.py` copy the following code. 

{: .note }
>TUD-facility can sometimes be unreliable, you can choose to use your phone hotspot instead.
>To do so change `settings.py` and set the **ssid** to the name of your hotspot and the **password** to your password.
>
>If you're using an iPhone it is necessary that you turn on the **Maximize-Compatibility** option in your hotspot settings.

MQTT_topic = "perlin"
#MQTT_topic = "iss/distance"
#MQTT_topic = "iss/location"
#MQTT_topic = "coffee-waiting-line"

# Listen for messages on the topic specified above
mqtt_client.subscribe(MQTT_topic)

> If you're trying to use the value received from MQTT for calculations, you might encounter the following errors.
> - TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
> - TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
>
> That's because the received value is in the form of text (string in python), so we need to convert it before we use it.
>
> - You can convert it to a whole number using: 
> `last_received_value = int(last_received_value)` 
> - Or to a decimal number using: 
> `last_received_value = float(last_received_value)`

</div>

3. With the code above we connect to an MQTT client, specify the **topic** and listen to the data being sent to it.
If you want to process the data received you can use the `last_received_value` variable in the `while True` loop.

In the next page we show some useful functions on how to process the data received.

## Extra Challenge: Use Advanced Components 

Now that you have successfully managed messages from MQTT, you can push your project further by incorporating additional components beyond the standard Connected Interaction Kit. 
This challenge encourages you to explore and integrate elements that can enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of your design.

Below are some components you can experiment with:
   - LED Strip (WS2812 / Neopixel)
   - LED Ring 
   - LED Segment Bar
   - LCD Screen
   - Speaker / MP3 Player
   - Fans

{: .note }
A basic introduction on how to use these components can be found here below:
