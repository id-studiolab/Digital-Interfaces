# Step 1: Setting up MQTT on your ItsyBitsy

{:.note}
   If you see the following error:    
   `File "code.py", line 6, in <module>`  
   `ImportError: no module named 'adafruit_connection_manager'`  
    then you need to update your ItsyBitsy and all the libraries. To do so, please check out [this page](https://id-studiolab.github.io/Connected-Interaction-Kit/support/) 

After successfully completing [Tutorial 4](https://id-studiolab.github.io/Connected-Interaction-Kit/tutorials/03-connect-to-the-internet/) and connected your ItsyBitsy to the Internet, follow the steps below to establish a basic MQTT connection with our MQTT server.

1. Download the [Circuit Python library bundle for Version 9.x](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) if you haven’t already. Do not copy the entire .zip bundle to your CIRCUITPY device! Instead copy over only the specific library folders that you need for this assignment. They are referenced in this tutorial. 
2. Search for `adafruit_minimqtt` and copy the whole `adafruit_minimqtt` library folder into the `lib` folder of your `CIRCUITPY` device
3. Extend your `secrets.py` file and add the entries for the MQTT broker (the server we connect to), your username (please construct it as **Studio[your studio]_YourName**), and add the access token below. Save the file afterwards.
   ```python
   secrets = {
      'ssid' : 'TUD-facility', # The wifi we connect to 
      'password' : 'replace-with-your-iPSK-String', # Our personal password to connect to Wifi
      'mqtt_broker' : 'ide-education.cloud.shiftr.io', # The MQTT server we connect to
      'mqtt_broker_user' : 'ide-education', # The username for connecting to the server
      'mqtt_broker_password' : '9RI9jcOCtnoIAESq', # The password for connecting to the server
      'mqtt_clientid': 'Studio5_Caspar', # The device name we present to the server when connecting
   }
   ```
4. This week we are introducing a new way of choosing what code should be executed on your ItsyBitsy. We think that this will help you when juggling or working on multiple prototypes or code tryouts at the same time.

   Create a new file called `mqtt_client.py` and paste the following code into it. It looks like a bunch, but you don’t have to worry about most of it. Save the file on your `CIRCUITPY` device.

   ```python

5. The ItsyBitsy always looks for the file `code.py` to run code. By passing the following one line in our `code.py` file and saving it, we instruct our ItsyBitsy to run all code found in the  `mqtt_client.py` file that we created in the previous step
   
   ```python
   import mqtt_client
   ```
   
   The benefit is that we keep our `code.py` tidy, and can quickly switch between different code iterations like so:
   
   ```python
   # Comment or uncomment the file you want to run
   #import mqtt_client
   import mqtt_led_color
   #import mqtt_servo_motor
   ```

6. Let’s `import mqtt_client` for now and save the file. Open the `Serial Monitor` and you should be receiving data!
