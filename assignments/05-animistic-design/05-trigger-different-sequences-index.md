# 03: Triggering different sequences based on context or interaction

How could we trigger different sequences based on user or context interaction? In this example, we will create a little ItsyCreature that sleeps peacefully until disturbed – in that case it wakes up and gets angry at the disturbance! 

Connect the Chainable LED to pin `D13`, the Servo Motor to pin `D2` and the Touch Sensor to `D3`. By default, the creature will “sleep” in peace, but when touched get angry until the sensor is released again.
